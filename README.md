# XIVLegacy Server

A server for **FINAL FANTASY XIV v1.23b**, the final patch of the original
1.0 release (not *A Realm Reborn*), written in Rust.

**Where it comes from.** XIVLegacy Server is derived from the original
community server work: it is a fork of
[Garlemald Server](https://github.com/swstegall/Garlemald-Server) by Samuel
Stegall, itself a Rust port of
[Project Meteor Server](https://bitbucket.org/Ioncannon/project-meteor-server/).
The lobby, world and map services, the 1.x wire protocol, the Blowfish-keyed
session handshake and the Lua content system come from there, under the same
AGPL-3.0 license, and fixes that apply to Garlemald are still offered
upstream.

**Where it's going.** Two goals, kept apart on purpose:

- **Retail accuracy in the core.** The game should behave the way 1.23b did in
  2012: its quests, combat, monsters, drops, notorious monsters and economy.
  When the core and retail disagree, the core is wrong.
- **Quality of life in modules.** Anything that isn't retail behavior (a
  welcome message, a status page for your website, a Discord bridge, faster
  travel, conveniences for a small community) goes in an optional
  [module](modules/README.md) that each server operator chooses to turn on.

Underneath, it is being rebuilt into a server you can host for real players:
one authority for who is online, settings that never touch tracked files, a
database with enforced relationships, and a target of 100 players at once. See
[docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the plan and its progress.

Players connect with the
[XIVLegacy launcher](https://github.com/tagban/xivlegacy-launcher) (Windows and
macOS), which sets up the 1.23b client from the original disc and patches and
joins a server. Only a client reporting version `2012.09.19.0001` can connect.

## Highlights

- Four services in one Cargo workspace (`web-server`, `lobby-server`,
  `world-server`, `map-server`) sharing a `common` crate for protocol, packet
  log, database, settings and modules
- Compatible with the 1.23b client byte for byte: TCP + Blowfish framing, 1.x
  opcodes, actor spawn fields, and the Director / ContentArea / PrivateArea /
  Zone / Weather state machines
- **1,142 Lua scripts** (quests, directors, shops, aetherytes, populace,
  commands) run by [`mlua`](https://github.com/mlua-rs/mlua) 5.4, with a
  coroutine scheduler for the upstream `_WAIT_TIME` / `_WAIT_SIGNAL` idioms
- **SQLite** with no database server to install: the schema is created and
  seeded on first run, with numbered migrations tracked in `schema_migrations`
- **Sessions:** the world server keeps `world_sessions`, the one record of who
  is in the game (one character per account), cleared at start-up and
  refreshed every 30 s so a crash never leaves ghosts
- **Settings:** shipped defaults in `settings/default/`, your changes in
  `settings/*.toml`, never in tracked files
- **Modules:** optional features with Lua hooks and their own tables; `status`
  serves players online and recent characters as JSON for websites
- **GM levels and chat commands:** `!zone`, `!camp`, `!warp` and more, each
  given to a GM level (player to administrator) in `settings/commands.toml`;
  see [settings/README.md](settings/README.md#gms-and-chat-commands)

## Project status

Account flow, character creation and selection, zones, NPC and monster
spawns, chat, movement, guildleves and status effects work end to end with the
1.23b client. Combat formulas, stat recalculation, levels and experience, and
the quest reward pipeline are partly done. The rebuild's phases (sessions,
modules, the relational monster/drop/NM schema, MariaDB, load testing) are
tracked in [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md).

```

## Quick start

Requires Rust 1.95 (pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`; `rustup` installs
it automatically on first build).

```sh
# Build every workspace member once, then launch the full stack.
# Per-server logs land in ./logs/{lobby,world,map,web}.log, and
# Ctrl-C propagates a clean shutdown to every child.
./scripts/run-all.sh
```

Individual services can be started on their own for debugging:

```sh
./scripts/run-web.sh     # HTTP signup/login on :54993
./scripts/run-lobby.sh   # Lobby / character-list on :54994
./scripts/run-world.sh   # World handoff on :54992
./scripts/run-map.sh     # Map / zone / AI on :1989
```

Windows hosts have `.cmd` equivalents of every script in the same
directory.

On a fresh checkout the first run will create `./data/garlemald.db`,
apply the bundled schema, seed every reference table, and boot the
stack on localhost. Add `127.0.0.1` as a server in the
[XIVLegacy launcher](https://github.com/tagban/xivlegacy-launcher), then use
Create Account and Join.

## Settings

Each service reads `settings/default/<name>.toml` (shipped, don't edit) with
your overrides from `settings/<name>.toml` on top, holding only what differs.
See [settings/README.md](settings/README.md), including what to change to host
for players on the internet.

| Service | Settings | Default bind | Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `web-server` | `web` | `127.0.0.1:54993` | Sign-up and sign-in; the `status` module's `GET /status` |
| `lobby-server` | `lobby` | `127.0.0.1:54994` | Character list and the hand-off to a world |
| `world-server` | `world` | `127.0.0.1:54992` | Sessions, routing to the map server, cross-zone chat, parties, linkshells |
| `map-server` | `map` | `127.0.0.1:1989` | Zones, actors, combat, AI and the Lua scripts |

The worlds shown at character select are `servers`, and the enabled modules
`modules`. `--config <file>` on a service names a different override file.

## Modules

Turn optional features on in `settings/modules.toml`:

```toml
enabled = ["status", "welcome"]
```

| Module | Default | Does |
|---|---|---|
| [status](modules/status/) | on | `GET /status`: players online and recently active characters with their starting city, for websites such as moghouse.cc |
| [welcome](modules/welcome/) | off | A welcome message as players enter the world; an example to copy |

Writing one: [modules/README.md](modules/README.md).

green (`fmt` / `clippy` / `build` / `test`). Fixes that also apply to Garlemald
are worth offering upstream too.

# Settings

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| `settings/default/<name>.toml` | Shipped defaults: one machine, localhost. Tracked; don't edit them |
| `settings/<name>.toml` | Your overrides: only what differs. Not tracked, so updates never touch them |

`<name>` is `web`, `lobby`, `world`, `map` or `servers`. Tables in an override
are merged key by key over the defaults; anything else, such as the
`[[servers]]` list, replaces the default outright. `--config <file>` on a
service names a different override file, and `XIVLEGACY_SETTINGS` a different
settings folder.

## Hosting for players on the internet

`settings/web.toml`, `settings/lobby.toml` and `settings/world.toml`, to accept
connections from other machines (the map server stays on 127.0.0.1: only the
world server talks to it):

```toml
[server]
bind_ip = "0.0.0.0"
```

`settings/servers.toml`, the address players are handed:

```toml
[[servers]]
id          = 1
name        = "Fernehalwes"
address     = "xiv.example.com"
lan_address = "auto"
port        = 54992
```

Forward TCP 54992-54994 on your router to the host; never forward 1989.

Quest Script

Name: 	Breaking the Seals
Code: 	Com0g1
Id: 	111601
Prereq: Level 22, not in another Grand Company.

The Order of the Twin Adder's test of a would-be recruit. Serpent
Lieutenant Fulke sends you to Quarrymill to drive out Ailith, an Ul'dahn
thaumaturge said to be cursing the Twelveswood's trees. Ailith will leave
only once the Archon Urianger, who has been burning glyphs into the trees,
is caught; her scouts place him southwest of Quarrymill. Urianger sets a
familiar on you (a duty entered in place, SimpleContentCom0g101) and
vanishes; Ailith accepts your report, swears a sealed oath to the wood, and
Fulke takes it and invites you to enlist: talking to him again inducts you
(PopulaceCompanyOfficer).

The client script (com0g1) names the events; seed 122 holds the cast, the
glyph-site trigger and the familiar.

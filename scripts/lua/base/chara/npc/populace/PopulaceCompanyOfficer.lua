eventDoRankUp(gcRank, gcRank)                   - Plays the join/rank-up effect and opens the GC window
eventRankUpDone(???, ???)                       - Has your character do the GC salute?  Values seem to do nothing?
eventRankCategoryUpBefore(gcRank)               - 11/21/31  - Mentions which GC quest you need to clear to continue promotion
